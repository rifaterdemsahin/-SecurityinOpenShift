To integrate OpenShift with image scanning tools like Clair, Quay, or Aqua Security for automated image scanning, you can configure the platform to scan images upon upload or before deployment. This integration helps enforce security policies by preventing the deployment of non-compliant images.

Below is a sample code snippet to demonstrate how to configure OpenShift to integrate with an image scanning tool and automate the scanning process. In this example, we'll use Clair as the image scanning tool.

### Prerequisites

1. **OpenShift Cluster**: Ensure you have an OpenShift cluster up and running.
2. **Image Registry**: Set up a container image registry like Quay that integrates with Clair for vulnerability scanning.
3. **Clair Setup**: Install and configure Clair to scan images stored in the image registry.

### Step-by-Step Integration

#### 1. Configure OpenShift Image Streams

Create an image stream in OpenShift to pull images from your integrated registry. Here’s how you can define an image stream YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
  name: example-app
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  lookupPolicy:
    local: false
```

Save this YAML file as `imagestream.yaml` and apply it to your OpenShift cluster:

```bash
oc apply -f imagestream.yaml
```

#### 2. Configure the Quay Registry with Clair Scanning

Ensure your Quay registry is configured to work with Clair for scanning images. You need to set up Clair in Quay's configuration to enable automatic scanning for vulnerabilities.

In Quay's `config.yaml`, add the following Clair configuration:

```yaml
SECURITY_SCANNER_ENDPOINT: "http://clair:6060"
FEATURE_SECURITY_SCANNER: true
```

Restart the Quay service after updating the configuration to apply changes.

#### 3. Set Up OpenShift Image Policies

Define an `ImagePolicy` object in OpenShift to enforce scanning policies. For example, only allow the deployment of images that are free of critical vulnerabilities:

```yaml
apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: enforce-security
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  reject: true
  matchPolicies:
    - matchType: vulnerability
      matchCondition: severity=high
      matchThreshold: 0
```

Apply the image policy to your OpenShift cluster:

```bash
oc apply -f imagepolicy.yaml
```

#### 4. Automate Image Scanning and Enforce Policies

To automate the scanning process and enforce security policies, configure OpenShift to automatically trigger scans upon image upload or before deployment. You can create a build config to automatically build and scan images:

```yaml
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: example-app-build
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  source:
    type: Git
    git:
      uri: "https://github.com/your-repo/example-app.git"
  strategy:
    type: Docker
  triggers:
    - type: ImageChange
  output:
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: example-app:latest
```

Apply the build config to OpenShift:

```bash
oc apply -f buildconfig.yaml
```

#### 5. Monitor and Manage Scan Results

Monitor the scan results using OpenShift’s web console or CLI. If a scanned image contains vulnerabilities, the configured image policy will prevent its deployment, ensuring that only secure images are used in your applications.

### Summary

By integrating OpenShift with an image scanning tool like Clair, Quay, or Aqua Security, and configuring automated image scanning, you can enhance your cluster's security posture by preventing the deployment of vulnerable or non-compliant images. This automated security measure helps ensure that your applications run only on images that meet your organization's security standards.
